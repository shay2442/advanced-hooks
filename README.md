## This is a repo where I am just practcing a lot of the stuff that I have learned at my time at Flatiron. I am working with APIs and refreshing some javascript language and some of the basics like .pop .splice .unshift etc. 

I also am still using this to keep current with react and trying different advanced-hooks
